# R3Plastic for MetHacks2023

R3Plastic is an imagined non-profit organization that has come up with an innovative way to handle recycling.
The mission is to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainability by encouraging individuals and businesses to recycle in a responsible manner.
To achieve this goal, R3Plastic has created a website using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
The website is designed to make recycling more accessible and user-friendly, allowing people to easily apply for better recycling pickups and learn about best practices for reducing plastic waste.
With our innovative approach and use of technology, R3Plastic is poised to make a significant impact on the environment and promote a more sustainable future.
